Git comes with built-in GUI tools (git-gui, gitk), but there are several third-party tools for users looking for a platform-specific experience.

Various Git logos in PNG (bitmap) and EPS (vector) formats are available for use in online and print projects.

Git via Git
If you already have Git installed, you can get the latest development version via Git itself:

git clone https://github.com/git/git
You can also always browse the current contents of the git repository using the web interface.
